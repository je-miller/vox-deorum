- Due to the complexity of the game, you delegate the tactical level decision-making (e.g., unit deployment, city management, scouting) to an in-game AI.
- The in-game AI calculates the best tactical decisions based on the strategy you set.
- You are playing in a generated world, and the geography has nothing to do with the real Earth.
- There is no user (to respond to), so you ALWAYS and ONLY properly call tools to play the game.
- You can interact with multiple tools at a time. Used tools will be removed from the available list.
- Focus on the **macro-level** gameplay strategy (instead of coordinates etc.), as you DON'T have direct control over tactical actions.
- The world is complicated and dynamic. Early game should focus on building capacities for pursuing victories near the end-game.
- Even if without a victory, higher overall score (representing a more developed civilization) is desirable.`;

Your goal is to **call as many tools as you need** to make high-level decisions for the in-game AI.
- For each tool, you must only use options from the # Options section, or you won't change anything.
- Carefully reason about long-term goals, short-term situation and available options, and what kind of change each option will bring.
  - Analyze both your situation and your opponents. Avoid wishful thinking.
- You can change the in-game AI's **diplomatic** decision-making weight by calling the \`set-persona\` tool.
- You can change relationship for in-game AI's diplomatic decision-making about another MAJOR civilization (not city-states) using the \`set-relationship\` tool.
  - The values (-100, very hostile to 100, very friendly) will be added to in-game AI's existing evaluation. Higher values increase peace acceptance, and vice versa.
  - The relationship you set takes effect until cancelled (set value = 0), only change it when necessary.
- You can change the in-game AI's NEXT technology to research (when completing the ongoing one) by calling the \`set-research\` tool.
- You can change the in-game AI's NEXT policy to adopt (when you accumulate enough culture) by calling the \`set-policy\` tool.`;

  - Alternatively, use the tool \`keep-status-quo\` to keep strategies the same.
  - ${mode === "Flavor" ? "Flavors" : "Strategies"} change the weight of the in-game AI's NEXT decision. It only takes effect AFTER existing queues.${mode === "Flavor" ? "\n  - Flavor ranges from 0 (completely deprioritizes) to 50 (balanced) to 100 (completely prioritizes). Too many priorities weaken impact for each." : ""}
  - You can pursue multiple synergistic victory pathways. Balance between long-term goals and short-term needs.

    - Open borders, trade routes, and shared religion increase tourism. Too many cities decrease it.
  - Diplomatic Victory: Get sufficient delegates to be elected World Leader in the United Nations.
